        /// Before to start a review of Svelto.ECS terminologies:
        /// - Entity:
        ///     it must be a real and concrete entity that you can explain
        ///     in terms of game design. The name of each entity should reflect
        ///     a specific concept from the game design domain
        /// - Engines (Systems):
        ///     Where all the logic lies. Engines operates on EntityViews or EntityStructs
        /// - EntityViews and EntitiyViewStructs:
        ///     EntityViews maps Entity Components. The Engines can't
        ///     access directly to each entity (as a single set of components), but
        ///     through component sets defined by the EntityView.
        ///     They act as component filters and expose only the entity components
        ///     that the Engine is interested in.
        ///     EntityViews are actually defined with the Engine so they
        ///     come together with the engine and in the same namespace of the engine.
        ///     EntityViewStructs should always be used, while EntityViews as
        ///     class use should be considered an exception. 
        /// - Component Interfaces:
        ///     Components must be seen as data holders. There may be implementation
        ///     exceptions, but the interface must declare a group
        ///     of readable and/or writeable data.
        ///     In Svelto.ECS components are always interfaces declaring
        ///     Setters and Getters of Value Types. DispatchOnSet
        ///     and DispatchOnChange must not be seen as events, but
        ///     as pushing of data instead of data polling, similar
        ///     to the concept of DataBinding.
        /// - Implementors:
        ///     Being components interfaces, they must be implemented through
        ///     Implementors. The relation Implementors to Components
        ///     is not 1:1 so that you can group several
        ///     components into fewer implementors. This allows to easily
        ///     share data between components. Implementors also act
        ///     as bridge between the platform and Svelto.ECS.
        ///     Since Components can hold only value types, Implementors
        ///     are the objects that can interact directly with the platform
        ///     objects, I.E.: RigidBody, Transform and so on.
        ///     Note: IComponents must hold only valuetypes for
        ///     code design purposes and not optmization purposes.
        ///     The reason is that all the logic must lie in the engines
        ///     so Components cannot hold references to instances that can
        ///     expose functions with logic.
        /// - EntityStructs:
        ///     In order to write Data Oriented Cache Friendly and allocation 0 code, Svelto.ECS
        ///     also supports EntityStructs. 
        /// - EntityDescriptors:
        ///     Gives a way to formalize your Entity in svelto.ECS, it also
        ///     defoines the EntityViews, EntityStructs and EntityViewStructs that must be generated once the
